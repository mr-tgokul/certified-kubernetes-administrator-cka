Run a temporary Pod with the container image alpine/curl:3.14 to make a call against the Service using curl.
Create a second Deployment named nginx-green with 3 replicas. The Pod template of the Deployment should use container image nginx:1.23.4 and assign the label version=green.
Change the Service's label selection so that traffic will be routed to the Pods controlled by the Deployment nginx-green.
