Question :

Create a Deployment named nginx with 3 replicas. The Pods should use the nginx:1.23.0 image and the name nginx. The Deployment uses the label tier=backend. The Pod template should use the label app=v1.
List the Deployment and ensure that the correct number of replicas is running.
Update the image to nginx:1.23.4.
Verify that the change has been rolled out to all replicas.
Assign the change cause "Pick up patch version" to the revision.
Scale the Deployment to 5 replicas.
Have a look at the Deployment rollout history.
Revert the Deployment to revision 1.
Ensure that the Pods use the image nginx:1.23.0.
(Optional) Discuss: Can you foresee potential issues with a rolling deployment? How do you configure a update process that first kills all existing containers with the current version before it starts with the new version?
